> [!note]
> **Preview Release**:
>
> The framework is under active development and currently in its beta phase.  
> If you encounter bugs or have suggestions on how the framework can be improved, please tell us about them (e.g. via [Issues](https://github.com/DH-Ng/TacEx/issues)/[Discussions](https://github.com/DH-Ng/TacEx/discussions)).


# TacEx - Tactile Extension for Isaac Sim/Isaac Lab
**TacEx** brings **Vision-Based Tactile Sensor (VBTS)** into Isaac Sim/Lab.

The framework integrates multiple simulation approaches for VBTS's and aims to be modular and extendable.
Components can be easily switched out, added and modified.

Currently, only the **GelSight Mini** is supported, but you can also easily add your own sensor (guide coming soon). We also plan to add more VBTS types later.

## **Main features**:
- [GPU accelerated Tactile RGB simulation](https://github.com/TimSchneider42/taxim) via [Taxim](https://github.com/Robo-Touch/Taxim)'s simulation approach
- Marker Motion Simulation via [FOTS](https://github.com/Rancho-zhao/FOTS)
- Integration of [UIPC](https://github.com/spiriMirror/libuipc) for GPU accelerated incremental potential contact to simulate FEM soft bodies, rigid bodies, cloth, etc. in a penetration-free and robust manner
- Marker Motion Simulation with FEM soft body based on the simulator used by the [ManiSkill-ViTac challenge](https://github.com/chuanyune/ManiSkill-ViTac2025) that leverages UIPC

## Installation
> [!NOTE]
> TacEx currently works with **Isaac Sim 4.5** and **IsaacLab 2.1.1**.
> The installation was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with a 4090 GPU and Driver Version 550.163.01 + Cuda 12.4.

**0.** Make sure that you have **git-lfs**:

```bash
# Need it for the USD assets
git lfs install
```

**1.** Clone this repository and its submodules:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DH-Ng/TacEx
cd TacEx
```

Then **install TacEx** [locally](docs/source/installation/Local-Installation.md)
or build a [Docker Container](docs/source/installation/Docker-Container-Setup.md).


## Contributing
Contributions of any kind are, of course, very welcome.
Be it suggestions, feedback, bug reports or pull requests.

Let's work together to advance tactile sensing in robotics!!!
